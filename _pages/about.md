Hello world! I'm a research intern in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/English/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/aspx/enmain/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). Currently, I'm a research assistant in [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), working with Prof. [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/). Before that, I'm a research intern in [Social Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/social-computing-beijing/), where I'm fortunate to work with [Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia), [Chaozhuo Li](https://whatsname1991.github.io/) and [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/). Please check my [CV](https://antman9914.github.io/files/CV.pdf) for further information.

My major research interest lies on graph machine learning, especially on improving the expressiveness, scalability and fairness of Graph Neural Networks, and making them generalizable to various forms of structured data. I'm also interested in the applications of graph machine learning, such as recommender systems, social networks, natural language processing and AI4Science. My recent work focus on fairness-aware graph machine learning and spatio-temporal graph embedding.

**I'm currently looking for a Ph.D. position starting in 2023 fall. If your lab is in need of a Ph.D. student majoring in graph machine learning algorithms and relevant learning theory, please contact me at <font color=Blue>*coldgentlema AT gmail DOT com* or *mayj_hedgehog AT ruc DOT edu DOT cn*</font>, and I'm willing to work as a self-funded research assistant in advance for better communication.**
