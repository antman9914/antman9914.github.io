I'm a first-year graduate student in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/English/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en), adviced by Prof. [Xiao Zhou](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/addons/teacher/index/info.html?user_id=0&ruccode=20210007&ln=en). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/aspx/enmain/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). Currently, I'm a research intern in [Social Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/social-computing-beijing/), where I'm fortunate to work with [Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia) and [Chaozhuo Li](https://whatsname1991.github.io/). Please check my CV for further information.

My major research interest lies on graph machine learning, especially on improving the expressiveness, scalability and fairness of Graph Neural Networks, and making them generalizable to various forms of structured data. I'm also interested in the applications of graph machine learning, such as recommender systems, social networks, long sequence modeling and general artificial intelligence. My recent work focus on fairness-aware graph machine learning, and heterogeneous graph learning.

**I'm currently looking for a PhD. position starting in 2023 fall or 2024 fall (Spring is also available). If your lab is in need of a PhD. student majoring in graph machine learning algorithms, please contact me, and I'm willing to work as a research assistant in advance for better communication.**
