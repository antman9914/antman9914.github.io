I'm currently a first-year graduate student in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/English/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en), adviced by Prof. [Xiao Zhou](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/addons/teacher/index/info.html?user_id=0&ruccode=20210007&ln=en). I'm also fortunately working as a research intern in [Social Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/social-computing-beijing/), hosted by [Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia) and [Chaozhuo Li](https://whatsname1991.github.io/). My major research interest lies on graph machine learning, especially on improving the expressiveness, scalability and fairness of GNN architectures. I'm also interested in their applications in recommender systems, social networks and natural language processing. My recent work focus on fairness-aware graph machine learning, and heterogeneous graph learning.

*I'm currently looking for a PhD. position starting in 2023 fall or 2024 fall (Spring is also available). If your team is in need of a PhD. student majoring in graph machine learning algorithms, please contact me, and I'm willing to work as a research assistant for better communication. *
