Hello world! I have just received my master's degree from [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm), Renmin University of China. I was supervised by Prof. [Xiao Zhou](https://xiaozhoucam.github.io/). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/aspx/enmain/), Wuhan University. I worked as a research intern in [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), where I was fortunate to work with Prof. [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/). Before that , I worked as a research intern in [Social Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/social-computing-beijing/), working with [Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia) and [Chaozhuo Li](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cli/). Please check my [CV](https://antman9914.github.io/files/CV.pdf) for detailed information.

My recent research interest lies on graph machine learning and recommender systems, especially on improving the fairness and explainability of graph-based recommender systems and exploring the dynamicity of user preference from the perspective of graph. I'm also interested in the broad applications of graph machine learning, such as natural language processing, scientific discovery and smart city. My recent work focus on degree-based fairness in friend recommendation and self-explainable social recommendation.

**I am currently looking for a Ph.D. position starting in 2025. Please contact me at <font color=Blue>fourthhand08 AT gmail DOT com</font> if you're interested.**
