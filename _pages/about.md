Hello world! I'm a master candidate in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/English/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://www.ruc.edu.cn/en). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/aspx/enmain/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I was a research intern in [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), where I'm fortunate to work with Prof. [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/). Before that, I was a research intern in [Social Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/social-computing-beijing/), working with [Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia) and [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/). Please check my [CV](https://antman9914.github.io/files/CV.pdf) for further information.

My major research interest lies on graph machine learning, especially on improving the expressiveness, scalability and fairness of Graph Neural Networks, and making them generalizable to various forms of structured data. I'm also interested in the applications of graph machine learning, such as recommender systems and AI4Science. My recent work focus on fairness-aware graph learning and spatio-temporal graph mining.

**I'm currently looking for a Ph.D. position starting in 2024 spring or fall. Please contact me at <font color=Blue>coldgentlema AT gmail DOT com</font> or <font color=Blue>fourthhand08 AT gmail DOT com</font> if you're interested, and I'm willing to work as a self-funded remote research assistant in advance for better communication.**
