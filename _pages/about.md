Hi! I am an incoming PhD student at [CSE](https://cse.nd.edu/), [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), where I will be fortunately advised by [Prof. Fanny Ye](http://yes-lab.org/). I received my master's degree at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xiao Zhou](https://xiaozhoucam.github.io/). Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/aspx/enmain/), Wuhan University. I worked as a research intern in [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) and [Social Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/social-computing-beijing/), where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/), [Dr. Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia) and [Dr. Chaozhuo Li](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cli/).
