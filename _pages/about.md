Hi! I am a first-year PhD student at [CSE](https://cse.nd.edu/), [University of Notre Dame](https://www.nd.edu/), where I am fortunately advised by [Prof. Fanny Ye](http://yes-lab.org/). I received my master's degree at [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/english/index.htm), [Renmin University of China](https://en.ruc.edu.cn/), advised by [Prof. Xiao Zhou](https://xiaozhoucam.github.io/). Before that, I completed my undergraduate studies at [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/aspx/enmain/), [Wuhan University](https://en.whu.edu.cn/). I worked as a research intern in [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/) and [Social Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/social-computing-beijing/), where I was fortunate to work with [Prof. Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/), [Dr. Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia) and [Dr. Chaozhuo Li](https://whatsname1991.github.io/). Please check my [CV](https://antman9914.github.io/files/CV.pdf) for detailed information (Until Jan 2025).

My research interests encompass topics in foundation models (e.g., graph foundation model and agent collaboration) and their applications in social science and public health. My recent research focuses on temporal graph learning and its application in opioid crisis. Please feel free to contact me if you are interested in my research or would like to explore potential collaborations.
