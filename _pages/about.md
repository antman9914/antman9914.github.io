Hello world! I'm currently a master candidate in [Gaoling School of Artificial Intelligence](http://ai.ruc.edu.cn/index.htm), Renmin University of China, advised by Prof. [Xiao Zhou](https://gsai.ruc.edu.cn/xiaozhou). Before that, I received my Bachelor's degree from [School of Computer Science](http://cs.whu.edu.cn/aspx/enmain/), Wuhan University. I was a research intern in [University of Illinois Urbana-Champaign](https://cs.illinois.edu/), where I'm fortunate to work with Prof. [Hanghang Tong](http://tonghanghang.org/). Before that, I was a research intern in [Social Computing Group, Microsoft Research Asia](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/group/social-computing-beijing/), working with [Jianxun Lian](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/jialia), [Chaozhuo Li](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/cli/) and [Xing Xie](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/xingx/). Please check my [CV](https://antman9914.github.io/files/CV.pdf) for further information.

My major research interest lies on graph machine learning, especially expressive, scalable and responsible graph representation learning for various forms of real-world structured data. I'm also interested in the applications of graph machine learning, such as recommender systems, social networks and natural science. My recent work focus on degree-based fairness in social network representation learning, spatio-temporal graph mining and explainable social recommendation.

**I'm currently looking for a Ph.D. position starting in 2024~2025. Please contact me at <font color=Blue>coldgentlema AT gmail DOT com</font> or <font color=Blue>fourthhand08 AT gmail DOT com</font> if you're interested, and I'm willing to work as a remote RA in advance.**
